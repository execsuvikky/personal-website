        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Viktoriia and I am studying linguistics at the Lviv Polytechnic National University. I was always
            interested in learning languages. My native language is Ukrainian, I used to study Spanish and currently I
            am
            studying English and Polish. Recently I decided to discover something new for me and so I am coding this
            page
            now.
